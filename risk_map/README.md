# risk_map/

This directory contains data models and intelligence primitives for the Stratum
risk intelligence layer. It is **not** part of the `stratum-cli` pip package.

`pip install stratum-cli` installs only the `stratum/` package (the scanner CLI).
The `risk_map/` module is used by the private Stratum backend for aggregation
and intelligence computation. It is included in this repo for schema documentation
and development reference only.
